# Translation Style Guide

This style guide defines localization conventions for translating Japanese video game content to English. Follow these rules consistently to maintain quality and cultural authenticity.

## Honorifics

Japanese honorifics should be **preserved** in English translations to maintain cultural authenticity and character relationships.

### Rules
- **PRESERVE** Japanese honorifics: -san, -kun, -chan, -sama, -sensei, -senpai, -dono
- **DO NOT** anglicize to Western equivalents

### Examples
| Source | Correct | Incorrect |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| 田中さん | Tanaka-san | Mr. Tanaka |
| 山本先生 | Yamamoto-sensei | Professor Yamamoto |
| 佐藤くん | Sato-kun | Young Sato |
| 花子ちゃん | Hanako-chan | Little Hanako |

### Exceptions
- When a character explicitly uses a Western title in the source
- When the game is set in a non-Japanese context

---

## Formality Levels

Match the source text's formality level in translation. Japanese has distinct formal and casual speech patterns that should be reflected in English.

### Rules
- **Formal speech** (desu/masu forms): Use complete sentences, proper grammar
- **Casual speech** (plain forms): Use contractions, casual phrasing
- **Rough speech** (masculine/informal): Use appropriate casual/rough English

### Examples
| Source Level | Japanese | English |
|--------------|----------|---------|
| Formal | ありがとうございます | Thank you very much. |
| Casual | ありがとう | Thanks! |
| Rough | サンキュー | Thanks, man. |

## Cultural References

Preserve culturally-specific terms when they add to the experience. Add brief contextual hints only when necessary for comprehension.

### Rules
- **Keep** Japanese terms for cultural concepts without direct English equivalents
- **Add context** through natural dialogue only if absolutely necessary
- **Never** replace with unrelated Western equivalents

### Examples
| Term | Treatment |
|------|-----------|
| 花見 (hanami) | Keep as "hanami" or "cherry blossom viewing" |
| お弁当 (obento) | Keep as "bento" not "lunch box" |
| 居酒屋 (izakaya) | Keep as "izakaya" not "bar" or "pub" |
| 温泉 (onsen) | Keep as "onsen" or "hot spring" |

## Character Voice Consistency

Each character should have a consistent voice throughout the translation.

### Rules
- Maintain consistent speech patterns for each character
- Preserve character-specific verbal tics or catchphrases
- Match the character's personality (shy, confident, formal, casual)

### Examples
- A shy character should use hesitant phrasing consistently
- A confident character should use assertive language
- An elderly character should use more formal/archaic speech

---

## Terminology Consistency

Use consistent terminology throughout the translation.

### Rules
- Follow the project glossary for game-specific terms
- Character names use established romanization
- Item names, location names, and abilities must be consistent

### Game Terms
- Translate game mechanics terms consistently
- If a Japanese term is kept, use it consistently throughout
- Don't mix translated and untranslated versions of the same term

---

## Punctuation and Formatting

### Rules
- Use standard English punctuation
- Preserve emphasis indicated in the source (bold, italics)
- Convert Japanese quotation marks 「」 to English quotation marks ""
- Convert Japanese ellipsis ……… to English ellipsis ...

### Line Length
- Keep translations concise to fit text boxes
- Prioritize natural English over literal translation
- Break long sentences naturally if needed for display
