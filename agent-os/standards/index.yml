# Agent OS Standards Index

architecture:
  api-response-format:
    description: All responses use pydantic-based {data, error, meta} envelopes
  log-line-format:
    description: All log lines use stable JSONL pydantic-based schema with {timestamp, level, event, run_id, phase, message, data} fields
  naming-conventions:
    description: Use consistent naming conventions across all code; snake_case for modules/functions/variables, PascalCase for classes/types

global:
  address-deprecations-immediately:
    description: Deprecation warnings must be addressed immediately; never defer to future work
  adapter-interface-protocol:
    description: Always access adapters through protocol interfaces; never use implementations directly
  prefer-dependency-updates:
    description: Prefer frequent dependency updates; use compatible ranges instead of exact pins
  thin-adapter-pattern:
    description: CLI, TUI, and API are thin adapters over rentl-core only; no core logic in surface layers

python:
  async-first-design:
    description: Design all APIs around async/await for parallel agent execution and efficient LLM network IO
  modern-python-314:
    description: Use Python 3.14 modern features; avoid legacy constructs and outdated patterns
  pydantic-only-schemas:
    description: Never use dataclasses or plain classes; all schemas must use Pydantic with Field and validators
  strict-typing-enforcement:
    description: Never use Any or object in types; all Pydantic fields use Field with description and built-in validators

testing:
  bdd-for-integration-quality:
    description: Integration and quality tests must use BDD-style (Given/When/Then)
  mandatory-coverage:
    description: Coverage mandatory for all features; tests must exercise actual behavior
  no-mocks-for-quality-tests:
    description: Quality tests use real LLMs; integration tests mock LLMs
  no-test-skipping:
    description: Never skip tests within a tier; tests either run and pass or run and fail
  test-timing-rules:
    description: Strict timing limits per tier: unit <250ms, integration <5s, quality <30s
  three-tier-test-structure:
    description: All tests in unit/integration/quality folders; unit <250ms, integration <5s, quality <30s

ux:
  frictionless-by-default:
    description: Guided setup and safe defaults for effortless first runs
  progress-is-product:
    description: Status, phase completion, and QA visibility must be immediate and unambiguous
  speed-with-guardrails:
    description: Fast iterations without sacrificing determinism or quality; speed and quality aren't tradeoffs
  trust-through-transparency:
    description: No silent stalls; every phase, error, and status must be visible and explainable
