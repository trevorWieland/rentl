# Trust Through Transparency

No silent stalls, no black boxes. Every phase, error, and status must be visible and explainable.

```python
# ✓ Good: Transparent, explainable behavior
async def translate_phase(config: Config) -> TranslationResult:
    """Translate phase with full visibility."""
    # Show what's happening
    await emit_event("phase_started", {
        "phase": "translate",
        "model": config.model,
        "scenes_to_process": len(config.scenes)
    })
    
    # Progress updates (not silent)
    for i, scene in enumerate(config.scenes):
        await emit_event("translation_progress", {
            "scene_id": scene.id,
            "line_number": i + 1,
            "total_lines": len(config.scenes)
        })
        result = await translate_single(scene, config)
        await emit_event("translation_completed", {
            "scene_id": scene.id,
            "status": "success",
            "tokens_used": result.tokens_used
        })
    
    # Show what happened, even on error
    except TranslationError as e:
        await emit_event("translation_failed", {
            "scene_id": scene.id,
            "error_code": e.code,
            "error_message": e.message,
            "retries_attempted": e.retries,
            "next_action": "Will retry with smaller context"
        })
        raise  # Re-raise but visibility is already emitted

# ✓ Good: Error messages explain what happened and why
Error: Translation failed for scene 42
Code: RATE_LIMIT
Details: API rate limit exceeded (100 req/min). Retrying in 30s...
Phase: translate
Scene ID: 42
Retry count: 1 of 3

# ✗ Bad: Silent or opaque behavior
async def translate_phase(config: Config) -> TranslationResult:
    """Translate phase - no visibility."""
    # No progress events
    results = []
    for scene in config.scenes:
        results.append(await translate_single(scene, config))  # Silent
    
    # No visibility into what happened
    except Exception as e:
        raise e  # Re-raise with no context

# ✗ Bad: Opaque error messages
Error: Translation failed
[No code, no details, no explanation of what went wrong]
```

**Transparency requirements:**
- **Phase visibility:** Always show phase start, progress, and completion
- **Error visibility:** Never fail silently; always emit error with context and next action
- **Progress visibility:** Show progress within phases, not just at phase boundaries
- **Status explainability:** Every status change has a reason or context

**Error messages must include:**
- **What happened:** Clear description of the failure
- **Why it happened:** Error code or context (e.g., rate limit, invalid config)
- **What's next:** Recovery action or next step (retrying, skipping, user intervention needed)
- **Phase context:** Which phase failed, which line/scene

**Progress visibility:**
- Emit events at meaningful milestones (every N lines, scene completions, etc.)
- Show what's being processed (line IDs, scene names, file paths)
- Show time elapsed and ETA for long operations
- Don't batch updates - emit as work progresses

**Never:**
- Silent failures (exception without context)
- Opaque error messages (generic "failed" without explanation)
- Long-running operations without progress (e.g., "waiting..." for >5 seconds)
- Hidden retries (don't retry 3 times silently; show each attempt)

**Why:** Users know if pipeline is working or stuck; failures and errors are visible and explainable; builds confidence in system behavior.
