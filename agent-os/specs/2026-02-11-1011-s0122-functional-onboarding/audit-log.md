- **Task 2** (round 1): FAIL — Task marked complete without the required unit-test update in `tests/unit/core/test_doctor.py` for dotenv loading behavior.
- **Task 2** (round 2): FAIL — Task still marked complete without dotenv-loading doctor-context unit coverage in `tests/unit/core/test_doctor.py`; coverage was added in `tests/unit/cli/test_main.py` instead.
