# Audit: s0.1.41 Documentation Overhaul for v0.1 Release

- Spec: s0.1.41
- Issue: https://github.com/trevorWieland/rentl/issues/125
- Date: 2026-02-17
- Round: 2

## Rubric Scores (1-5)
- Performance: 5/5
- Intent: 4/5
- Completion: 3/5
- Security: 5/5
- Stability: 4/5

## Non-Negotiable Compliance
1. Getting Started guide is copy-pasteable: **FAIL** — Step 8 uses a hardcoded run path (`docs/getting-started.md:206`) that is not generated by the tutorial. Running it as documented fails: `uv run rentl export -i out/run-01936a52/en.jsonl -o translation.csv -f csv` → `No such file or directory` (exit code 11).
2. Architecture doc matches code: **PASS** — documented phase order in `docs/architecture.md:31` matches `packages/rentl-schemas/src/rentl_schemas/primitives.py:73`; orchestrator and key types referenced in `docs/architecture.md:50`, `docs/architecture.md:62`, and `docs/architecture.md:63` exist at `packages/rentl-core/src/rentl_core/orchestrator.py:265`, `packages/rentl-core/src/rentl_core/orchestrator.py:239`, and `packages/rentl-schemas/src/rentl_schemas/pipeline.py:73`.
3. Schema reference matches Pydantic models: **PASS** — documented `SourceLine` and `TranslatedLine` field tables (`docs/data-schemas.md:58`, `docs/data-schemas.md:75`) match model definitions (`packages/rentl-schemas/src/rentl_schemas/io.py:53`, `packages/rentl-schemas/src/rentl_schemas/io.py:69`); phase I/O and QA schema tables align with `packages/rentl-schemas/src/rentl_schemas/phases.py:204` and `packages/rentl-schemas/src/rentl_schemas/qa.py:17`.
4. No copyrighted text ships in PyPI packages: **PASS** — benchmark source text is fetched at runtime (`packages/rentl-core/src/rentl_core/benchmark/eval_sets/downloader.py:14`); packaged benchmark files contain metadata/slices only (`packages/rentl-core/src/rentl_core/benchmark/eval_sets/katawa_shoujo/manifest.json:4`, `packages/rentl-core/src/rentl_core/benchmark/eval_sets/katawa_shoujo/slices.json:2`).
5. CHANGELOG covers all shipped specs: **PASS** — roadmap has 37 completed `s0.1.xx` specs (`agent-os/product/roadmap.md:29` onward), and automated cross-check found no missing completed IDs in `CHANGELOG.md` (`CHANGELOG.md:14` onward).
6. All new docs cross-linked from README: **PASS** — README links all required docs at `README.md:324`, `README.md:325`, `README.md:326`, and `README.md:327`.

## Demo Status
- Latest run: PASS (Run 2, 2026-02-17)
- Run 2 results are generally convincing: all 6 demo checks reported PASS in `agent-os/specs/2026-02-17-1536-s0141-documentation-overhaul/demo.md:46`.
- Full verification gate note: demo did not include `make all`; this audit ran a non-mutating equivalent (`ruff format --check`, `ruff check`, `ty check`, unit/integration/quality pytest suites), which completed successfully.

## Standards Adherence
- `ux/copy-pasteable-examples`: violation (High) — hardcoded export command in `docs/getting-started.md:206` is not executable after following the tutorial without manual path editing.
- `ux/stale-reference-prevention`: violation (Medium) — schema doc claims named phase artifact files under `.rentl/artifacts/{run_id}/` (`docs/data-schemas.md:226`, `docs/data-schemas.md:443`), but runtime stores `artifact-{artifact_id}.jsonl` (`packages/rentl-io/src/rentl_io/storage/filesystem.py:517`) with a global index (`packages/rentl-io/src/rentl_io/storage/filesystem.py:202`).
- `ux/frictionless-by-default`: violation (Medium) — tutorial flow still requires implicit manual correction at export step due the hardcoded run path (`docs/getting-started.md:203`, `docs/getting-started.md:206`).
- `global/no-placeholder-artifacts`: PASS — no unresolved placeholder tokens remain in the new documentation command examples.

## Regression Check
- Prior Task 3 placeholder fix regressed in effect: placeholder token was removed, but command remains non-copy-pasteable due fixed run-id path (`agent-os/specs/2026-02-17-1536-s0141-documentation-overhaul/audit-log.md:4`, `docs/getting-started.md:206`).
- Previously fixed architecture and README benchmark-source corrections remain intact (`agent-os/specs/2026-02-17-1536-s0141-documentation-overhaul/audit-log.md:6`, `agent-os/specs/2026-02-17-1536-s0141-documentation-overhaul/audit-log.md:16`).
- `signposts.md` is absent for this spec folder, so no deferred/resolved signpost exceptions apply.

## Action Items

### Fix Now
- Task 3: Replace the hardcoded export input path in `docs/getting-started.md:206` with a command that works without manual edits after the tutorial flow (audit round 2).
- Task 5: Correct artifact storage/file-name claims in `docs/data-schemas.md:226` and `docs/data-schemas.md:443` to match actual storage behavior in `packages/rentl-io/src/rentl_io/storage/filesystem.py:202` and `packages/rentl-io/src/rentl_io/storage/filesystem.py:517` (audit round 2).

### Deferred
- None.
