# Audit Log

Running record of all task audits, demo runs, and spec audits.
Future auditors: check this log for regressions and patterns.

- **Task 2** (round 1): PASS — CHANGELOG includes all completed v0.1 roadmap specs and satisfies task acceptance criteria.
- **Task 3** (round 1): FAIL — `docs/getting-started.md` Step 3 uses `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` and GNU-only `sed -i`, but init-generated projects use `RENTL_LOCAL_API_KEY`; setup instructions are not copy-pasteable on a fresh machine.
