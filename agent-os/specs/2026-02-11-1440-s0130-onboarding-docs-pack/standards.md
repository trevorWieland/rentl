# Standards: Onboarding Docs Pack

## Applicable Standards

1. **ux/frictionless-by-default** — Guided setup and safe defaults for effortless first runs
2. **ux/trust-through-transparency** — No silent stalls; every phase, error, and status must be visible and explainable
3. **ux/progress-is-product** — Status, phase completion, and QA visibility must be immediate and unambiguous
4. **architecture/thin-adapter-pattern** — Surface layers (CLI, TUI, API) are thin adapters; all business logic lives in the Core Domain
